
m files are for comparing the numerical results obtained by QuTip
and the analytical expressions in main text.

py files are corresponding QuTip program codes.

mat files are relevant data generated by QuTip program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

fit_3L_PL.m is for comparing  PL spectra.
the data generated by QuTip program paper3_3L_PL.py is PL_qutip.mat, which should be loaded before running the code.


fit_3L_spec.m is for comparing  scattering spectra.
the data generated by QuTip program paper3_3L_sca.py is spec_qutip.mat, which should be loaded before running the code.


fit_3L_SE.m is for comparing  SE dynamics.
the data generated by QuTip program paper3_3L_SE.py is time_qutip.mat, which should be loaded before running the code.


fit_3L_corr.m is for comparing  two-time correlation function.
the data generated by QuTip program paper3_3L_PL_sigmaz.py is corr_qutip.mat, which should be loaded before running the code.


sz.nb is for plotting the exact two-time correlation function.
paper3_3L_CP.py is for numerically examining whether the dynamics is completely positive (CP).
